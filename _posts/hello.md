# Hello World

## About Me

I'm a chemistry graduate student at the University of South Florida in the Liu group, researching supramolecular chemistry. I've created this site to host my CV, have a blog for my accomplishments and to document my coding projects. I'm currently finishing my thrid year in the program and have one first author publication coming out. I've also begun learning to program in python to eventually use to help me understand, modify, and create molecular dynamics simulations and for personal projects.

## hello.py

Here's an example python file which can be run from a command line to write "hello, world" or "hello, `yourname`" if you pass it to the program. This code is from the google python class <a href = "https://developers.google.com/edu/python/">here</a>:

```python
#!/usr/bin/python3
import sys

# Define a main() function that prints a little greeting.
def main():
  # Get the name from the command line, using 'World' as a fallback.
  if len(sys.argv) >= 2:
    name = sys.argv[1]
  else:
    name = 'world'
  print('hello', name)

# This is the standard boilerplate that calls the main() function.
if __name__ == '__main__':
  main()
```

## Thanks for Checking This Out
Here's a cool picture that I took at Kennedy Space Center. Bye!
