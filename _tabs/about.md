## Alexander Mariscal
I'm a chemistry graduate student at the University of South Florida in the Liu group, researching supramolecular chemistry. I've created this site to host my CV, have a blog for my accomplishments and to document my coding projects. I'm currently finishing my thrid year in the program and have one first author publication coming out. I've also begun learning to program in python to eventually use to help me understand, modify, and create molecular dynamics simulations and for personal projects.

Here's how I began my journy learning Python. It took me 2 weeks off and on to complete all of the exercises.
